        and</li>

        <li>You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright,
        patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that
        do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and</li>

        <li>If the Work includes a "<strong>NOTICE</strong>" text file as part of its distribution, then any
        Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works,
        in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative
        Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a
        display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The
        contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may
        add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum
        to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.
        <br>
        <br>
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different
        license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any
        such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise
        complies with the conditions stated in this License.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>5. Submission of Contributions</strong>. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
      intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
      conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing
      herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with
      Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>

      <p><strong>6. Trademarks</strong>. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and
      customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>

      <p><strong>7. Disclaimer of Warranty</strong>. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing,
      Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
      WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
      warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
      You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and
      assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>

      <p><strong>8. Limitation of Liability</strong>. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort
      (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
      grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages,
      including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages
      for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
      damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

      <p><strong>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability</strong>. While redistributing the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
      indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting
      such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any
      other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
      liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such
      warranty or additional liability.</p>

      <p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
